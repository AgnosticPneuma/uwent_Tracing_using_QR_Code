Application which tracks people who you meet. 
This application will have a QR generator and a scanner.When a person meets another person or be boards a bus or he visits a shop, he scans the qr code displayed there. And the details fetched from scanning is stored as a row in the google sheet which will be automatically created in your gmail account when Loggedin in first.
By this way, you dont need to have a concern on disclosing your visits to any other third party.
And if unfortunately if the person gets affected with covid, he can submit his route map which is a button click away.

(Haven't connected the the screens using navigator. Please RUN through the DART files seperately.
